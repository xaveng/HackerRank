/**
 * Your teacher has given you the task of drawing a staircase structure. Being
 * an expert programmer, you decided to make a program to draw it for you
 * instead. Given the required height, can you print a staircase as shown in the
 * example?
 * 
 * Input You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.
 * 
 * Output Print a staircase of height N that consists of # symbols and spaces.
 * For example for N=6, here's a staircase of that height:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      #
 *     ##
 *    ###
 *   ####
 *  #####
 * ######
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note: The last line has 0 spaces before it.
